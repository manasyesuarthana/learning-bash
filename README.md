# Learning Bash
Just a random repository of mine filled with bash scripts that I wrote as I learn more about scripting. It's pretty fun! 

I may or may not update this repo with more scripts as I learn more new things :v

## Tech Stack
It's just linux and bash...

## Getting Started
Feel free to clone this repo and try some of the scripts yourself. Though keep in mind that some may not work since some hosts are only available through my device. 

**NOTE:** This script is for bash. It only works for a linux shell.

1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/manasyesuarthana/learning-bash.git
```

2. Go to the directory
```
cd learning-bash
```

3. Give execute permissions to the script you want to run
```bash
chmod 700 <script_name>.sh
```

4. Execute the script you want
```bash
./<script_name>.sh
```
